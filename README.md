## Analysis Report

### Data Overview
The dataset includes key economic variables such as M1 money supply, exchange rate, stock market index, and inflation rate for the USA.

### Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis reveals the relationships between these variables. Notably:
- M1 Money Supply and Stock Market Index show a strong positive correlation.
- Inflation Rate has a negative correlation with the Stock Market Index.

### Theoretical Framework
Our theoretical framework assumes that productivity can be modeled as:
\[ \text{Productivity} = \frac{\text{M1 Money Supply}}{\text{Inflation Rate}} \times \frac{\text{Exchange Rate}}{\text{Stock Market Index}} \]

### Productivity Model
The productivity model indicates that:
- Productivity appears to fluctuate over time.
- There are periods of significant increase and decrease, reflecting economic events and policies.

### Implications
The observed correlations and productivity trends provide insights into how monetary policies and market performance interact. Further research is needed to refine the model and explore causality.

## Conclusion
The analysis successfully correlates key economic variables and develops a preliminary productivity model for the USA. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's accuracy and exploring time-shifted correlations.
